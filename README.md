## Deploy

Deploys via **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to `inertia.it.com`, a shared Ubuntu box (`104.131.183.186`) that also hosts several other sites under the same `deploy` account (see `~/Sites/pocketproducer-web` for another app on the same host — this setup mirrors it). Every push to `main`: runs the full backend test suite, builds the webpack frontend, builds the Rails API's Docker image (`backend/Dockerfile`), streams the compressed image over SSH into `docker load` on the host, then runs `deploy/deploy.sh`. The script copies the frontend build for nginx to serve and starts Rails behind `/api` and Active Storage. The database is a **DigitalOcean managed MySQL cluster** (not co-located with the app). No container registry, Kamal, Capistrano, or building on the server itself.

No Redis and no `/cable` route in production: `app/channels` is unused rails-new boilerplate (no real-time feature anywhere in the app), so `config/cable.yml`'s production adapter is `async`, not `redis`.

No `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`/`config/master.key` needed either: production sets `SECRET_KEY_BASE` directly as an environment variable, which Rails reads before ever attempting to decrypt `config/credentials.yml.enc`, and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is what `config/initializers/devise.rb` actually checks first for signing auth tokens. Verified end-to-end locally (built the production image, ran it with only these two secrets set — no master key anywhere — against a real MySQL container, and completed a real signup that returned a valid JWT).

`~/Sites/server-config` is **bootstrapping-only** — it installs Docker/nginx/certbot, creates the shared `deploy` account and its narrow sudoers grant, and ships the nginx snippets every vhost includes. It never touches this app's own directory, nginx vhost, or certs; `deploy/deploy.sh` in this repo owns all of that (compose file, `.env`, container lifecycle, this app's nginx vhost, its own `certbot` call), per that repo's README "Conventions for per-app deploy scripts".

### One-time setup

1. Point `inertia.it.com` (and `www.inertia.it.com`) at `104.131.183.186` — not done yet as of this writing. Certbot's webroot challenge (and the whole nginx vhost) needs this to resolve before anything else here works.
2. `deploy/server_setup.sh` — creates this app's database on the managed MySQL cluster (needs a `mysql` client locally; no SSH/sudo required). Requires the machine running it to be in the cluster's **Trusted Sources** in the DigitalOcean control panel, or it'll hang trying to connect. Prompts for the cluster host/port — same cluster as `~/Sites/pocketproducer-web` if this is sharing that infrastructure.
3. Install this app's narrow sudoers grant on the server, by hand, as `admin` — see `deploy/server/sudoers.d/inertia-web`'s own header for the exact commands. This is on top of the shared grant `~/Sites/server-config`'s `bootstrap.sh` installs for `deploy`, and covers only this app's own vhost content and its one `certbot` invocation.
4. In Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add the repository secrets `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, and `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` (a private key whose public half is authorized on the `deploy` account). Add `DATABASE_PORT` as a repository variable (defaults to `25060`) and optionally `RAILS_ENV` (defaults to `production`). Generate `SECRET_KEY_BASE`/`JWT_SECRET_KEY` with e.g. `openssl rand -hex 64` — they don't need to relate to anything already in `config/credentials.yml.enc`.
5. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually) — this first run transfers the image, brings up the container, picks and persists a `HOST_PORT`, installs an HTTP-only vhost, requests the TLS cert via `certbot certonly --webroot`, then swaps in the full HTTPS vhost. See `deploy/deploy.sh`'s own header for the exact bootstrap order and why it matters (nginx can't reload with a vhost pointing at cert files that don't exist yet).

### Ongoing deploys

Just push to `main` — the workflow transfers `inertia-backend:latest` and the frontend build, then `deploy/deploy.sh` re-runs in full. To run the script by hand, first load that image onto the host and build `frontend/dist`, then run:
```
SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -hex 64) JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) DATABASE_HOST=... DATABASE_USERNAME=... DATABASE_PASSWORD=... deploy/deploy.sh
```

Useful host-level one-offs from `~/Sites/server-config` (bootstrapping/inspection only — never this app's deploy):
```
./site.sh list                  # every site on the host, its port, its cert expiry
./site.sh logs inertia.it.com   # tail container logs
./site.sh pull-nginx            # mirror the server's /etc/nginx into that repo's nginx/, to check for drift
```
